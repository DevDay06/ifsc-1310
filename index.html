            <h3>Ocean Nails Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
          </hr>
            <p>For this assignment I asked the owner of Ocean Nails Supply along with a friend of mine for feedback
              on my draft. The owner of the company wass not really tech savy and told me that they
              trusted my judgement on the project and thought that it looked
              really good. Even thought that it looked better than their website.
              My other fiend gave me a lot of feed back, laos because she saw the actual website of the company. 
              The suggestion that she provided me with was changing the color of the faqs page on the 
              accordions. I started off with white, but it did not look that good.
              Also encouraged me to add some underlines to when the FAQs are opened so that it did not 
              appear to be one big paragraph. I changed the header photo on the website
              the updated photo looks brighter, and also allows the content to stand out 
              I also added some code to the style sheet for the accordions under after open so that it would
              have a white line to separate. I chose to make these changes from the 
              feddback because I agreed with the information.
              It actually makes it look better.
            </p>
            <p>I would say working on this project definitely tested my abilities. There were times that I cried.
              At one point in time I lost my entire project and felt like just giving up completely.
              I normlly try to work things out on my own, but being that my grade was on the line I contacted my professor
              for assistance. Thankfully I had done that because I was able to recover the projects. 
            </p>
            <p>My experience this semester was extremely eye-opening. I have had some experience with coding prior to
              starting this semester. But I quickly learned that I may not know everything that I thought I did.
              I think that I did pretty well on most of the assignments, but when it came to the final I quickly became overwhelmed.
              I think what also was the hardest for me, was that I am working two full time jobs and attending school while taking 
              care of kids. I think that I would have taken my boss up on his offer to
              maybe log out of the queue during leacture times. Or that I would 
              have asked questions more. I kind of let the fact that I attempted to get help
              earlier in the semester, but the information was not correct; push me away from saying that I felt like I needed help. 
              I also feel like I should have spoken up more.
            </p>
            <p>This cousre goes really fast, and I do not think that I was prepared for that.
              I think that the last few weeks of class I kind of checked out. I felt like it just went
              too fast, and then we learned js and other things at one time. I just got really overwhelmed, I 
              may have even missed some deadlines. I still showed up to lectures, and tried to engage.
              Overall I think that this is a really great class. I got to learn some new tricks. I will continue to 
              apply what was taught and learned. I know that with more practice and consistency I'll get better. 
            </p>
            <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
          </hr>
          <p>My thoughts on progressive enhancement are that it is a web development strategy that focuses on 
            delivering a functional and accessible experience for everyone, no matter the browser capabilities. 
            Sort of like what we spoke about towards the beginning of the class with building solid foundations 
            and functioning site using semantic HTML, adding in some CSS to crate the style (look) and finishing 
            it off with JS for interaction. Similar to how the broke down the M&M peanut with the peanut representing the HTLM, 
            the chocolate represents the CSS (the users don’t see what we do but they can see it with their experience), and 
            then the hard coated candy which represents the JSI liked that example because I am one of those that eats the Peanut M&M’s 
            in layers, I eat the hard part first then I eat the chocolate and then savor the peanut ad each layer adds some form of 
            enhancement similar to coding. This confirms that each layer helps with the end users experience without interfering with the functionality. </p>
