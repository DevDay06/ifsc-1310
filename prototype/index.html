and religious activities and interests.</p> <p>Some of the services offered by the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are 
intramural sports and fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer tutoring, student government 
association, student support programs including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, 
a student-run newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life.</p> <p>The proximity of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown
